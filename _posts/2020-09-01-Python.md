At this time I'll introduce Python Library Statistics. <br />

With Library Statistics, you can check the normal statistics, such as sum, mean, median, etc. <br />
Here is the Python codes below: <br />


```python

### Library Statistics for checking statistics
import statistics

# select the part of data
NUMBER[8]
NUMBER[10:20]

statistics.mean(NUMBER)
statistics.variance(NUMBER)

print isNumber("NUMBER[0]")

# basic functions
NUMBER.isnull().sum()
NUMBER.sum(0)
NUMBER.mean()
NUMBER.median()
NUMBER.min()
NUMBER.max()
NUMBER.std()

```
