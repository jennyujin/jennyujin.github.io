At this time I am going to show you some basic statistical functions in Python Library Numpy :) <br />

You may know mean, variance, standard deviation, etc. <br />
You can simply use Numpy for calculate these statistics. <br /><br />

Here is the Python codes below: <br />


```python

### Library Numpy
# You can define numpy as shorter abbreviation, np
import numpy as np

# generate samples
sample = (1, 2, 5, 9, 200) 

# check statistics
np.mean(sample) # mean
np.var(sample) # variance

np.std(sample) # standard deviation
np.max(sample) # maximum
np.min(sample) # minimum
np.median(sample) # median

np.percentile(sample, 25) # Q1
np.percentile(sample, 50) # Q2 = median
np.percentile(sample, 75) # Q3
np.percentile(sample, 46) # 46th percentile

```
