Today let's practice how to check the ranks of the data with the function, RANKING. <br />

And also this post includes the function GROUP BY, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, COUNT().  <br />

These are the codes I often used when managing DB data at the previous company. Hope it helps you too. <br />

Here is the SQL codes with some examples below: <br /><br />


```sql

-- CHECK ALL COLUMNS 
-- select * means all variables
-- That is, the following code can print all variables in table
SELECT * FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME 


-- CHECK EACH VARIABLES 
-- Check how many items of variable VAR1 are
-- Meaning of 1st code: It leaves count variables, and the variable name is COUNT
SELECT DISTINCT VAR1, COUNT (*) AS COUNT 
  FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME 
  GROUP BY VAR1 
; 

  
-- CHECK PK (Primary Key) 
-- Ranking within the group
-- Determine groups with VAR1 and sort the order with VAR2
-- Leave the row number as a variable, the name of the variable is RANKING
SELECT *, 
Row_number() over(PARTITION BY VAR1 ORDER BY VAR2 desc) RANKING 
FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME 


-- CHECK PK-UNIQUE VALUE
-- COUNT items by grouping VAR1, VAR2, and VAR3 with a separator
-- pk can be checked for uniqueness - all must be 1
SELECT VAR1, VAR2, VAR3, COUNT (*) AS COUNT
  FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME 
  GROUP BY VAR1, VAR2, VAR3


-- CODE AND NAME MATCH
-- Check if VAR1_CD and VAR1_NM match 1:1
SELECT DISTINCT VAR1_CD, VAR1_NM  
    FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME 


-- CHECK SPECIFIC VALUE
-- Use where statement to print rows with specific values
-- Useful when extracting specific values
SELECT VAR1, VAR2, VAR3
    FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME
    WHERE VAR1 = 'Endometrioid-'


-- COUNT COLUMN OBS
-- Count the number of observations for each variable
SELECT count(VAR1)
    FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME

SELECT count(VAR1),count(VAR2),count(VAR3),count(VAR4)
    FROM DB.ADMIN.TABLENAME

```
